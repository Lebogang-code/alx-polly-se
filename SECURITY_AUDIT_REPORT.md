# Security Audit Report - ALX Polly Application

## Executive Summary

This report documents the security vulnerabilities identified in the ALX Polly polling application and the corresponding fixes implemented to address these issues.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Broken Access Control in Admin Panel**
**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** `app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`

**Issue:** The admin panel was accessible to any authenticated user without proper authorization checks. Any logged-in user could view and delete all polls in the system.

**Impact:** 
- Unauthorized access to sensitive admin functionality
- Ability for any user to delete other users' polls
- Complete compromise of data integrity

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added proper authorization checks using `ADMIN_USER_IDS` array
- Created secure server actions in `admin-actions.ts`
- Implemented client-side and server-side authorization validation
- Added proper error handling and user redirection

### 2. **CRITICAL: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` - `deletePoll` function

**Issue:** The `deletePoll` function did not verify poll ownership, allowing any authenticated user to delete any poll by providing its ID.

**Impact:**
- Users could delete polls they don't own
- Complete loss of data integrity
- Potential for malicious data destruction

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added ownership verification using `user_id` check
- Implemented proper authentication validation
- Added input validation for poll ID parameter

### 3. **HIGH: Input Validation Vulnerabilities**
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** Multiple files in `app/lib/actions/`

**Issue:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization across all server actions, potentially leading to:
- XSS attacks through malicious poll content
- SQL injection (though mitigated by Supabase ORM)
- Data corruption through invalid inputs

**Impact:**
- Cross-site scripting attacks
- Data integrity issues
- Application crashes from invalid data

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive input validation for all server actions
- Implemented length limits and type checking
- Added sanitization for user inputs
- Prevented duplicate poll options
- Added email format validation
- Implemented password strength requirements

### 4. **HIGH: Vote Manipulation**
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` - `submitVote` function

**Issue:** Multiple vulnerabilities in the voting system:
- Users could vote multiple times on the same poll
- No validation of option index bounds
- Anonymous voting allowed (commented out authentication)

**Impact:**
- Poll results manipulation
- Invalid vote data
- Compromised poll integrity

**Fix Implemented:**
- Enforced authentication requirement for voting
- Added duplicate vote prevention
- Implemented option index validation against poll options
- Added comprehensive input validation

### 5. **MEDIUM: Rate Limiting and Security Headers**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`

**Issue:** Missing rate limiting and security headers, making the application vulnerable to:
- Brute force attacks
- Clickjacking
- MIME type confusion attacks

**Impact:**
- Potential for automated attacks
- Security header bypass
- Cross-site scripting risks

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP)
- Implemented security headers:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### 6. **MEDIUM: Authentication Input Validation**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`

**Issue:** Insufficient validation in login and registration functions could lead to:
- Account enumeration
- Weak password acceptance
- Invalid user data

**Impact:**
- Security bypass attempts
- Data quality issues
- Potential account compromise

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added email format validation
- Implemented password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters)
- Added input sanitization and length limits
- Normalized email addresses (lowercase, trimmed)

## Security Improvements Summary

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Proper admin role verification
- ✅ Ownership-based access control for polls
- ✅ Enhanced authentication validation
- ✅ Secure session management

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation across all endpoints
- ✅ Length limits and type checking
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Prevention of duplicate data

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Vote manipulation prevention
- ✅ Poll ownership verification
- ✅ Duplicate vote prevention
- ✅ Option index validation

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Rate limiting implementation
- ✅ Security headers configuration
- ✅ Error handling improvements
- ✅ Proper server action architecture

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. Database Security
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Add database-level constraints and validations
- Set up proper indexing for performance

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- Replace in-memory rate limiting with Redis or similar
- Implement different rate limits for different endpoints
- Add progressive penalties for repeated violations

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Set up security monitoring and alerting
- Add performance monitoring

### 4. Additional Security Measures
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Add CSRF protection tokens
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Implement API versioning

### 5. Admin Management
- Move admin user management to database
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add admin activity logging
- Create admin user management interface

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments
2. **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate SAST/DAST tools
3. **Input Fuzzing**: Test all inputs with malicious payloads
4. **Load Testing**: Verify rate limiting effectiveness
5. **Access Control Testing**: Verify all authorization checks

## Conclusion

The security audit identified several critical vulnerabilities that have been successfully addressed. The application now implements proper access controls, input validation, and security measures. However, additional hardening measures should be considered for production deployment.

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and do not break existing functionality for legitimate users while significantly improving the security posture of the application.
